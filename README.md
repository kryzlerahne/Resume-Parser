## Features

### üìÑ Resume Upload Support

The app supports uploading resumes in both **PDF** and **Microsoft Word (.docx)** formats. This ensures compatibility with the most commonly used resume file types.

### üîç Intelligent Resume Parsing

Upon file upload, the app automatically extracts key information using text parsing logic (or external libraries, if applicable). The fields extracted include:

* **First Name** *(required)*: Identifies the candidate‚Äôs given name.
* **Last Name** *(required)*: Extracts the candidate‚Äôs family name.
* **Email Address** *(required)*: Detects and captures the primary email from the resume text.
* **Contact Number** *(required)*: Parses for valid mobile or telephone numbers.
* **Work Experience** *(required)*: Extracts job titles, companies, and durations of past employment.
* **Education** *(required)*: Retrieves details such as degrees, institutions, and graduation years.
* **Skills** *(optional)*: Attempts to identify and extract technical and soft skills if mentioned.

### üìù Pre-filled Editable Registration Form

Once data is extracted, it automatically populates a user-friendly registration form. Every field remains **editable**, so users can verify or correct the data before submission.

### ‚úÖ Real-time Form Validation

The form enforces validation rules:

* All required fields must be filled before submission.
* Inline feedback alerts users to missing or invalid inputs.
* The **Submit** button is disabled until all validation criteria are met.

### üì§ Form Submission and Confirmation

Upon successful submission:

* The app displays a summary of the submitted information.
* Useful for confirmation, record-keeping, or further processing.

### üì± Responsive Design

Designed to be **mobile-friendly and responsive**, the UI adapts gracefully to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

### üé® Branded UI Consistency

The look and feel of the interface is styled to be consistent with platforms like **WorkAbroad.ph**, providing a familiar and professional user experience. Tailwind CSS is used for styling to ensure fast, clean, and scalable design.
